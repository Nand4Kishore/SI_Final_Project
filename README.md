# Bing Web Search single-page app

This project demonstrates how the Bing Web Search API can be used to retrieve search results based on a user's query. 

The sample app can:

* Call the Bing Web Search API with search options
* Display web, image, news, and video results
* Manage subscription keys
* Handle errors

To use this app, an [Azure Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with Bing Search APIs is required. If you don't have an account, you can visit [the Microsoft Cognitive Services Web site](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/), create a new Azure account, and try Cognitive Services for free.
